My fascination with web development goes all the way back to the days of Livejournal blogging in the early 2000s, where I would tinker around with CSS styling to make custom themes. Eventually I went off to university where I was interested in so many things, but there was no clear path to become a web developer so I pursued other interests.

I honed professional soft skills in several jobs and ended up working as a Project Manager. In that position I learned that I enjoy technically challenging jobs, helping to create something, and also expressing my creativity. I came to two realizations: that web development is something I am incredibly passionate about, and that I can forge my own path to this career regardless of formal education.

Now I'm incredibly passionate about all the possibilities that JavaScript can offer, the advances of CSS (no more float layouts!), as well as more esoteric topics such as WCAG accessibility and information architecture.

At the end of the day, though, I love taking concepts and designs and figuring out how to turn them into reality.
